# Repos - C++

This is Repos, an aglomeration of C++ projects i had to make in high school


## Setup

These projects were made in Visual studio 2022
 - [Visual studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

But you can run them in any IDE, just as onlinegdb

 - [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)

You just need to go to the project folder you want and open the [project name].cpp, copy the content inside the file or open the file itself on your IDE of choice
